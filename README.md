# Daily Devotional Companion

## Project Overview

Daily Devotional Companion is a React and Supabase-powered spiritual assistant built with Lovable. Authenticated members can generate guided devotionals, ask faith-centered questions through an AI chat interface, and journal their reflections while receiving prompts, prayers, and reflections generated by Gloo AI. Supabase Edge Functions (`gloo-devotional`, `gloo-chat`, and `gloo-journal`) provide the personalized content layer, while shadcn-ui components deliver a polished experience across desktop and mobile.

## Key Features

- Secure Supabase email authentication with persistent sessions.
- Devotional builder that accepts topics or Scripture references and returns formatted reflections.
- Conversational "Spiritual Chat" with follow-up question suggestions, backed by the `gloo-chat` Edge Function.
- Journaling workspace with AI-generated reflections, prayers, and fresh prompts from the `gloo-journal` function.
- Responsive UI built with shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query for client-side caching.

## Tech Stack

- Vite, React 18, and TypeScript for the frontend build system.
- Supabase for authentication, database, storage, and Edge Functions.
- shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI primitives for design.
- TanStack Query for data fetching and caching.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file (or update the existing one) with your Supabase project details:

```sh
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://<your-project>.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<public-anon-key>"
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="<project-id>"
```

These values are required for local development so the app can authenticate users and call the Supabase Edge Functions.

## Developing Locally

1. Clone the repository using the Git URL from your Lovable project.
2. Change into the project directory.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `bun install`, if preferred).
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev` and open the printed URL in your browser.

While running locally, the app will communicate with the Supabase project configured in your `.env`. Ensure the Edge Functions (`gloo-devotional`, `gloo-chat`, `gloo-journal`) are deployed and accessible from that project.
